The authors of HexMadness do not want your private information and do not collect your information using Hex Madness.

Hex Madness does not harvest any customer information. The only outbound network connections it makes are to allow the player to submit their GameCenter alias and score to Apple GameCenter leaderboards, or to allow the player to submit an App Review (as of September 2024 the current version doesn't even make GameCenter connections, but we may add that feature)

Hex Madness does not include any 3rd party or advertisement libraries or frameworks.
